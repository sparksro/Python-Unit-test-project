Python based unit tests project
- Unit tests of C++ classes tested to run in both 2.7 and 3.5 Python

This python based project was for fun and practice.  It operates and compiles a C++ based set of class files through a test driver in main.  It outputs the results to a .txt file.  You can read more specifics in the various file headers.  I have tested the script to run both in 2.7 or 3.5 versions of python but suspect it will run in version between.  If you experience an error, try one or the other confirmed tested versions.  This code is posted free to use and distribute but please site me and a quick email to let me know how it was of use would be nice.  I welcome comments and constructive criticism. You can contact me at FOOsparks.rob.d@gmail.comBAR (remove the FOO and BAR) â€“ an attempt to beat the
robots ;)

To run it: place all the files in one file, navigate to the file in a terminal and launch in the command line with python ./shapes_testcode.py
Assuming it runs it will tell you your installed version of python at the top of the shapes_test_results.txt file.
